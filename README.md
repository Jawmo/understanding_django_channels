# understanding_django_channels
Working around and trying django channels.

Here's a chat room that consists of two pages.
On the main/home page, you enter the name of the chatroom you want to join.
On hitting Submit, you're directed to a Chat Room page.
The Chat Room page displays all previous messages in big box.
Below it, there is an input field where you can type in your message and hit 'Send' Button.
And WOW! Your message is displayed in the big box live.

This is just a basic version of the idea.
I plan to add many more functionalities into this which I'm soon going to list in the Ideas.txt file.
If you have some good ideas, please feel free to contribute.
