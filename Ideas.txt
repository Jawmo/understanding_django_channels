Here I'm gonna list down the ideas I have on my mind for extending this project.

1) Add a user login and register functionality.
2) User Profiles : Display Picture, bio, description, website and social handles.
3) Display name and pic thumbnail of sender of message against each message.
4) Add functionality of sharing files (audios, videos, docs, etc).
5) Add follower/following feature.
6) Notifications tab where user is told about activity of the users he/she follows.
7) Categorising chat rooms by catgeories and allowing user to follow hashtags under categories.
   Based on these hashtags, suggesting user good chat rooms to join.
